|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Model Factories
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This directory should contain each of the model factory definitions for
| your application. Factories provide a convenient way to generate new
| model instances for testing / seeding your application's database.

In this above code, we are defining a factory for App\User::class model and passing it as the first parameter. 
Then we have a callback function that defines the data and returns it in an array. Array keys are the name of the columns of the users table. 
We are using Faker which is a very useful library for creating fake data. Hereâ€™s a description of all the faker properties used.

        'name' => $faker->name,
        'email' => $faker->unique()->safeEmail,
        'email_verified_at' => now(),
